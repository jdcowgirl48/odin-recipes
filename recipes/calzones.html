        <p>These calzones are huge and delicious!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            2 lb pizza dough
            1 cup pizza sauce
            1 cup pepperoni
            1/2 cup salami
            2 cups shredded mozzarella
            1 cup ricotta Cheese
            2 tablespoons oil
            1/2 cup parmesan cheese
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            Preheat the oven to 475 Â°F. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it with oil.
            Divide the dough into 8 equally sized pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4" thick circle.
            Place the filling on half of each circle (pizza sauce, ricotta, pepperoni, salami and shredded mozzarella). Make sure to leave the edges clean to allow for sealing the calzone. Fold the side over the filling and crimp the edges.
            Place calzones on a baking sheet, leaving space apart. Cut a small vent on the top of each calzone. Brush the tops with oil and sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
